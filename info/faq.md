<h3>Resume Questions</h3>
<dl>
<dt>
Why doesn’t my resume look like the original version?
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The resume preview is designed based on the feedback we’ve received from employers. We worked with them to ensure the most important elements were visible in a way that they wanted to see it. This includes the formatting of the sections and the order they appear in.</p>
<p>Occasionally, some characters that are used within a resume document do not carry over properly from your Word or PDF documents to our systems (due to formatting such as hidden HTML code, which is found in all Word documents or tables, borders etc.). In such cases, the information may get rearranged or misplaced during the conversion.</p>
<p>If your resume is not uploading correctly, one solution is to select the ‘Don’t have a resume? Start from scratch’ option and then copying and pasting the details of your resume into the template.</p>
<p>Be sure to always preview your resume before submitting it.</p>

      What is a draft resume?
  </dt>
<dd>
<p>If your resume is a work in progress, you can always save it as a draft and finish it later. Your draft resume is private and you must finish it before you can use it to apply to jobs or have it searchable to employers.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
What is a searchable resume?
</dt>
<dd>
<p>When you upload or create a new resume, you have the opportunity to make it searchable to employers. In the privacy section under ‘resume options’, check off the box to make your resume discoverable by employers. Your resume will then be entered into our resume database and be visible to hiring employers. This will increase your chances of having an employer find and contact you when they have a job that matches your experience and skills.

<h3>Job Applications</h3>
<dl>
<dt>
      I’m not sure how to apply to a specific posting, what should I do?
  </dt>
<dd>
<p>The method of applying varies for each posting. The best thing to do would be to read the posting carefully and follow the instructions indicated by the employer.</p>
<p>Within a job posting, you will find either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apply Now Button – This button will allow you to apply directly via Workopolis using either your Word/PDF document or the resume/cover letters located in your account. With this method if you do not already have a resume in your account, you will be prompted to create one.</li>
<li>A link that takes you directly to an employer-specific career site – In this case you will find your next instructions on that employer’s site. Please note that these accounts are separate from the Workopolis site.</li>
<li>Via Email or Fax – In some postings the employer will list an email address or fax number for you to send your resume.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you do not see one of the above methods, or if you are still unclear about a particular posting, please <a href="http://www.workopolis.com/shared/en/contactus/seeker">Contact Us</a> and send us a link to the posting in question and we will be happy to assist further.

<h3>Job Alerts</h3>
<dl>
<dt>
      How do I create a Job Alert?
  </dt>
<dd>
<p>Creating Job Alerts is as easy as 1-2-3</p>
<ol>
<li>Simply search for jobs that interest you by using the job search bar at the top of any Workopolis page.</li>
<li>Then, on the search results page that displays jobs that are relevant for you, enter your email address, a name for your new Job Alert and click on the ‘Create Alert’ button in the ‘Email Me Jobs Like These’ box.</li>
<li>Lastly, check your email to activate your Job Alert.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>You can unsubscribe from Job Alerts at any time and if you have a Workopolis Account, you can also change the delivery frequency of Job Alerts or edit them at any time.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
      I don’t need my Job Alerts anymore how can I stop them?
  </dt>
<dd>
<p>You can unsubscribe from your Job Alerts at any time. Simply open up a Job Alert email and click on the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of the email.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you have a Workopolis account, you can sign in to your account and delete Job Alerts directly from your dashboard by clicking on the ‘Delete’ button.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
      Why aren’t my Job Alerts delivering the types of jobs I’m looking for?
  </dt>
<dd>
<p>Job Alerts that do not deliver the types of jobs you’re looking for may require more refinement around the job search criteria. This can include adding more keywords for the job title; a city; or more.</p>
<p>Here are some additional tips to help you optimize your alerts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that your search terms are not so specific that your search results are limited.</li>
<li>Consider changing the frequency of your alerts – daily or weekly – to ensure you don’t miss out on any great job opportunities.</li>
<li>Avoid spelling errors or typos in the keywords and locations to ensure job matches.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>You must be registered for a Workopolis account in order to make changes to your Job Alert. </p>
<p> To modify your existing Job Alerts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.workopolis.com/account/en/signin/">Sign in</a>  to your Workopolis account.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the Job Alerts section.</li>
<li>Click on the ‘Edit’ button beside the title of the Job Alert that you wish to modify.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
You can also create separate Job Alerts to ensure that you receive different job search results based on various search criteria combinations by clicking on the ‘Add an alert’ link.
