      There are a few different options to build Jekyll. The simplest way to is simply open a Terminal/Command window inside your Jekyll folder and type <code>gulp</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also run <code>gulp jekyll-build</code>. This will build the Jekyll site expose the UI editor. This editor is available at <a href="http://localhost:4000/admin">http://localhost:4000/admin</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="admin">Jekyll Admin UI Editor</h2>

    <p>
      The admin interface allows people to edit portions of the site without working directly with code. For example, a user cannot directly edit a page.html file but they can edit any translations, data file or collections that are used on the page.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, on the <a href="http://hiring.workopolis.com/all-solutions">All Solutions</a> page while a non-technincal user would not be able to edit the layout of the page, they would be able to edit:

      <ul>
        <li>
          All text and translations
        </li>
        <li>
          Product cards stored in the _products collections
        </li>
        <li>
          Customer testimonials stored in data files
        </li>
      </ul>

      If Optimizely is available on the page, a non-technical user would also be able to change the position of each block of content on the page.
